# PLAN
### Done:
- Player creation, **not balanced** among primitives.
- Player move and power sources affection from environment.
- Transference, energetic surge and regeneration: speed and amount are fixed, weight **not balanced**
- Resistances are presented, **not balanced**.

### TBD:
1. Heat and OverHeat levels basics.

2. Move to and point of interest address book.

3. Curses basics from environment to deminish excessive resistances, causing overheat.

4. Calculate total effectiveness composing all stats,  
Tune Stats affection on player properties.

5. Leveling functions:  
Creation - Empower (up olds' stats randomly),  
Alteration - Branding I and II (merge, downgrade, closest to conditions),  
Destruction - Sprouting (new, split, downgrading).

6. Calculate Leveling progression.

7. Tune Leveling progression (1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 5, 5, ...[x5], 8[x8], 13[x13] ...).

8. Elemental compatibility chains.

9. Enemies: harmless and harmful[elemental]:  
Bug[0], Rabbit[0], Firefly[2],  
Wasp[1], Dog[0], Hog[0], Hunger[5]...  

10. Casting scheme primitives:  
Creation: volume and area,  
Alteration: time and cast speed,  
Destruction: damage effectiveness, penetration, chaining, overheat.

11. Fractal connections:  
Point to point: 1-1,  
Crossing: 1+1, 2+2, 2+2+2, 3+3, 2+2+2+2, 4+4, 3+3+3,  
Fractal: 1<1, - each return to new,  
Clustering: extra socket for receiving, group cast.

11. Overheating damage.

12. Overheating major and dried minor conditions:
